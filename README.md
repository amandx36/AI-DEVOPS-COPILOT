🔷 2. What is SDK structure?
✅ SDK = Software Development Kit

    It is a package/library provided by a service (like OpenAI) to make it easier for developers to use their API.


✅ SDK structure refers to how classes, functions, and methods are organised inside the SDK to access different functionalities. 

All the modern api use this format 

# Design of the open ai for the call for the different purpose !! 
| **Functionality**   | **Method**                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Chat completions    | `client.chat.completions.create()`     |
| Image generation    | `client.images.generate()`             |
| Audio transcription | `client.audio.transcriptions.create()` |
| Embeddings          | `client.embeddings.create()`           |







# API PART OF KNOWLEDGE BROOO 

If you change "role" to anything else (e.g., "speaker") or "user" to "person", the API will throw an error, because it does not recognise it.


| **Key**     | **Required?** | **Allowed values**                  |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `"role"`    | ✅ Required    | `"system"`, `"user"`, `"assistant"` |
| `"content"` | ✅ Required    | Your text message                   |



🔷 1. Why do we write response.choices[0].message.content?

analogy 02 
response
 └── choices (branch) [list]
       └── [0] (first leaf)
            └── message (sub-branch)
                 └── content (final fruit 🍎)

output of the api form openai !! 

✅ Because the response returned by OpenAI is structured like this:
{
  "id": "...",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": ...,
  "model": "gpt-4o",
  
  "choices": [    <-- ✅ This is a list of choices (outputs). By default, it has 1 item at index [0].
    {
      "index": 0,   <-- ✅ This is the index = 0 (first output).

      "message": {  <-- ✅ This is the 'message' key containing AI's reply.
        "role": "assistant",  
        "content": "Here is your AI-generated answer..."  
        // ✅ 'content' is the **actual text answer** generated by ChatGPT.
      },

      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],

  "usage": {...}
}
